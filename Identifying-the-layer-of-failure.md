# Identifying the Layer of Failure

Many IT issues seem complex at first — but most problems exist within a specific “layer” of the system.

Understanding where a failure lives is key to resolving it efficiently.

## The Common Layers of Failure

### 1. Power Layer
- Device not turning on
- Random shutdowns
- Charging issues

If power is unstable, nothing else matters.

---

### 2. Hardware Layer
- Faulty RAM
- Failing storage
- Overheating
- Peripheral malfunction

Hardware issues often present as instability or performance problems.

---

### 3. Operating System Layer
- Corrupt system files
- Driver conflicts
- Update failures
- Service crashes

The hardware may be fine — but the OS may not be functioning properly.

---

### 4. Application Layer
- Software crashes
- Configuration errors
- Compatibility issues

If only one program fails, the issue is often isolated here.

---

### 5. Network Layer
- No internet access
- DNS resolution failures
- Slow connectivity
- Authentication timeouts

Connectivity issues are extremely common in support environments.

---

### 6. User Layer

Yes — user interaction matters.

- Incorrect credentials
- Misunderstood features
- Accidental settings changes

Many issues originate here.

## Why Layered Thinking Matters

Instead of reacting emotionally to a problem, layered thinking allows you to ask:

- Which layer is most likely responsible?
- What evidence supports that?
- What can I test quickly to confirm?

This approach reduces guesswork and increases efficiency.

## Final Thought

Strong IT support is not about memorizing fixes.

It is about understanding systems in layers and identifying where failure truly occurs.
