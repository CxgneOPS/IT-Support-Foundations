# Troubleshooting & Systems

This repository is a collection of foundational concepts focused on structured troubleshooting and system-level thinking.

The goal is to build and document practical knowledge that applies to real-world IT environments — from basic Help Desk scenarios to understanding how smaller systems combine into larger, functional systems.

## What This Repository Covers

- Structured troubleshooting methodology
- Layered system analysis
- Identifying root causes of technical issues
- Understanding subsystems and integration
- Practical IT fundamentals

Rather than focusing on memorization, this project emphasizes how to think through technical problems clearly and methodically.

## Why This Matters

In IT support and system environments, most problems are not complex — they are misidentified.

Breaking systems into layers and isolating variables allows for faster resolution, better documentation, and more reliable outcomes.

Strong troubleshooting is built on structured thinking.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A growing technical knowledge base
- A reference for foundational IT concepts
- A demonstration of problem-solving mindset
- A framework for continuous improvement

More topics will be added as the repository evolves.
